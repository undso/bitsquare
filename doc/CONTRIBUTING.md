Contributing to bisq
============================

Pull requests
--------------------

To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:

  - Fork repository
  - Create topic branch from Development branch
  - Commit patches
  
Please do not make pull requests to the Master branch but always use the Development branch!


Workflow for merging code
---------

We are aiming to follow the principles and establish the workflow used at the Bitcoin Core project. 
Please check out the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.
The full workflow is not used yet as there are not that many dedicated developers yet, but as soon that situation changes we will move 
to a model with ACK/NACK, code reviews and maintainer roles.
